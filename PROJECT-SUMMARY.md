## Compliance Logic

### Calculation
```
Compliance % = (Attendance % + Syllabus %) / 2
```

### Status Assignment
- **Compliant**: ≥ 75%
- **Pending**: 50% - 74%
- **At-Risk**: < 50%

### Reminder Triggers
- **Gentle** (65-75%): Soft reminder to update records
- **Formal** (50-65%): Official notice to take action
- **Escalation** (< 50%): Urgent action required

## Security Features

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Faculty can only access their own data
2. **Authenticated-only access** - All tables require authentication
3. **Secure password handling** - Handled by Supabase Auth
4. **Encrypted storage** - All data encrypted at rest
5. **No exposed credentials** - Environment variables for sensitive data

## CSV Format Support

The system accepts CSV files with any of these column headers:
- `percentage`
- `percent`
- `value`

Additional columns are ignored but can be included for reference.

## Sample Files Included

1. **sample-attendance.csv** - Example attendance data
